# Why is Visual Studio Code here?

VS Code has built-in Git which makes the setup less hassle.

VS Code not just limited to have built-in feature such as `Git`, it also support wide varieties of extension. User settings also will be sync across device which is perfect for someone that always changing their setup often. I rarely change my setup but if I do.

The setup process for `Git` will be more or less the same as to other system.
