# How to revert a work

There's a moment where you wanted to revert the work done to a file. Here's how to revert a work/file.

Example: (fishballs.cpp)

## Git Bash

1. Open up [Git Bash](../done/gitbash.md)
2. [Navigate](../done/terms.md) to the project folder
3. Type in `git restore`&nbsp;*`file_that_you_wanted_to_restore`*

## Visual Studio Code

| Original Files                 | Modified Files                 |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| ![image](../pics/revert_1.png) | ![image](../pics/revert_2.png) |

To revert from modified files to unmodified/original file,

1. Click on the icon "arrow pointed to the left" on the top right corner

    ![revert_3](../pics/revert_3.png)

2. The VS Code will show you something like this,

    ![revert_4](../pics/revert_4.png)

3. To revert some part of the lines (for example, removing the line 14), you can directly edit on the right panel

    | Before                         | After                          |
    |--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
    | ![iamge](../pics/revert_5.png) | ![iamge](../pics/revert_6.png) |

4. And proceed with coding!
