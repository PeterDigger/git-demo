# Visual Studio Code or Git + another Editor?

The benefit of using open source software is about the freedom of choices, you can choose any way or form to use the software.

## Choices

Combinations that I came up with for using `git` are:

1. Git + Code Editor (commonly known as Notepad++, Atom, Brackets, Visual Studio Code). [Easy]
2. Git only (Command lines and etc.) [Hard]

## Code Editors

If you decided to use `Git + Code Editor`, Which code editor to use?

- **Notepad++** - Basic functionalities such as edit, save, delete. Open source
- **Atom** - Many themes, open source. "A hackable text editor" means you edit the source code of the editor to suit your liking.
- **Brackets** - Focued on visual tools and preprocessor support. and it is made for web designers and front-end developers.
- **Visual Studio Code** - Has built in `Git`, Open Source, Sync settings.

## Recommendation

Visual Studio Code has built in `Git` so that's why I would recommend using Visual Studio Code to for this group assignment.

But if already get used to the the code editor that you have, just do some research on how to use `Git` on that code editor.

It all boils down to one's choices. You want to use other editor, go for it. So long as you able to execute/use `Git`.
