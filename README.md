## Why use git?

Git is a version control software to help manage your codes. Codes can have a lot of version if there's lots of collabroration involved.

## Question

Q: How's git can apply to our group project?

A: Our git workflow has multiple branches. Each branch will be maintained by each group member. After everyone finalized their branch, I (Chong) will merge every branch to a single branch which is `Main Branch.`

Example:

```nothing
📁 Main
|- 📁 (Basic nagivation) Kila
|- 📁 (Log In page) Hilmi
|- 📁 (Booking page) Xav
|- 📁 (Admin page) Evan
|- 📁 (Dark theme) Chong
```

Q: What and Why is Visual Studio Code?

A: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a IDE for you to code and do lot of awesome things. It comes with minimal configuration. It is up for user to tinker and add extension and etc. You can use git inside the VS Code.

## **TL;DR**

> Using Git / Git on VS Code will save time from transitioning to your friends code without download any files manually

<details>Yes, I do agree that sharing a zip file on WhatsApp will be much more easy. But here's the thing, if one of us wanted to help on someone else on certain problem, you can help them by fetch the code from the internet instead of uploading to WhatsApp. Everything will be much more seamless. Helping people will be much more seamless instead of downloading zip file then extract it, then read it.</details>

By using GitHub on online, you can share your code easily without making mess.
